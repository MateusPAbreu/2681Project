            <li>1. Why do you meet on a weekly basis?</li>
            <div>
                <p>As with any exercise regime or meditation practice, the greatest growth comes from writing on a
                    regular
                    basis. It is through the weekly experience of both self-connection (articulating your thoughts and
                    feelings on paper) and social-connection (speaking your truth and having it affirmed by others) that
                    young people develop confidence in their own unique voice.</p>

                    myself.”

            <li>What happens in class?</li>
            <div>
                <p>The short answer is: a lot! The magic of every class is that writers keep learning about themselves
                    and
                    growing stronger as people, empowered by the enthusiastic support of their peers. This is made
                    possible
                    by the fact that we offer a very structured "safe container," balancing instruction, discussion,
                    writing
                    and sharing with consistently empathetic feedback.</p>

                <p>For example, every class starts with instruction and discussion related to the theme of the class.
                    Then
                    we offer a writing "prompt" to inspire the day's writing. Depending to the maturity level of the
                    class
                    (older teens tend to write longer), everyone writes in silence for 20-45 minutes. When everyone is
                    finished writing, we take turns reading our writing out loud and giving positive feedback, in
                    accordance
                    with the Amherst Writing Method.</p>

                <p>We believe the Amherst Writing Method is one of the most beautiful and encouraging writing
                    methods in
                    existence. It insists that we are all writers, that we all deserve unconditional creative support,
                    and
                    (to protect the privacy of the writer) that all writing is regarded as fiction and given only
                    positive
                    feedback, focused on the strength and authenticity of the writer's unique voice. When young people
                    hear
                    others affirm and appreciate their words, they realize their value and own their power.</p>

            <li>Will my child get personalized support?</li>
            <div>
                <p>We have designed our programs to ensure personalized support—individualized encouragement, coaching
                    and
                    mentorship—for every writer in every class. We do this by keeping classes small, with no more than
                    six
                    writers per group. Within such a safe-space, young people also develop deep emotional bonds with
                    each
                    other.</p>

                <p class="quote">“I feel so safe here. I can share things here that I can't share anywhere else.”

            <li>Will this program improve my child's writing skills?</li>
            <div>
                <p>Yes, absolutely! The more young people write, the more articulate they become. And the best way to
                    get
                    kids to write more often is to make it fun, to support them in writing about what they love and what
                    feels meaningful to them. That said, this is a writing-based empowerment program, so our first
                    priority
                    and primary focus is on strengthening the inner self. In other words, we use writing as as a tool—as
                    "the way in"—for fostering emotional intelligence, personal growth, mental health, and self-esteem.
                </p>

                <p>Instead of teaching technique or grammar, we support a love of both writing and self-inquiry. Because
                    of
                    this, our writers tell us that writing essays for school is "so much easier!" In fact, very few of
                    our
                    students need help on their college application essays because they already know who they are and
                    how to
                    tell their story. When young people are connected to their strengths and empowered to speak their
                    truth,
                    they are naturally eloquent.</p>

            <li>What if I miss a class?</li>
            <div>
                <p>Unfortunately, we cannot provide refunds for missed group classes. In the summer, we try to honor
                    family
                    vacation time by offering free make-up classes. During the school year, however, we are only closed
                    for
                    school holidays and missed classes cannot be refunded. Instead, we offer up to two private make-up
                    classes per quarter, available on request.</p>

            <li>Is there any homework?</li>
            <div>
                <p>No homework ever! Each class is its own a self-contained experience. At the same time, girls are
                    encouraged to use writing as a tool for personal clarity, self-discovery, and emotional
                    self-care—whenever and wherever they need it!</p>

            <li>What's it like meeting online?</li>
            <div>
                <p>While we understand the apprehension about signing up for yet another online program, we have discovered
                that the magic of writing together in the same room still exists on Zoom! In fact, our students tell us
                that writing with us is "the opposite of school," and the one place they feel like they can really
                connect with their friends. That said, there's no substitute for personal experience. Because we want to
                empower teens to make their own decision, the first class is always considered a “taste test." If your
                child doesn't love the first class, we will provide a full refund.</p>

                <p class="quote">“Both of my girls LOVE writing in your programs! I am so happy it worked out for them to do this. We are
                thrilled to see how they are being inspired and that their love of writing is growing. The online format
                works surprisingly well, too! ... Never before has finding and using your voice and being creative been
                more useful ... Less driving has been another perk!” — TIWP parent</p>

                <p class="quote">“My daughter looks forward to your class all week. You are making a real and huge difference in her
                life. I really just can’t say enough about it. It’s remarkable how she’s found her voice with you. You
                have given so much and she is forever changed and expanded.” —TIWP parent</p>
