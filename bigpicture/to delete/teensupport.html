        <h1>Why Young People Need Our Support</h1>
    </div>

    <div class="body">
        <p>Most people don't listen to teens—but we do. Listening is the foundation of everything we do. At The
            Intuitive Writing Project, we are here to listen to and amplify the voices of young people, to hold space
            for their thoughts, feelings and ideas, affirming their experiences and mirroring back their unique
            strengths. Through carefully curated content and class discussion, we challenge teens to think for
            themselves. Then, after they have written their thoughts on paper, we are here to validate and encourage
            their insights.</p>

        <p>It’s not easy being a young person. It’s never been easy. But with social media, it’s become a lot more
            complicated. Teens today—especially girls*—are facing epidemic levels of anxiety, depression and despair.
            According to a recent report from the US Surgeon General, “half of all female teens” have reported
            “persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness.” (*Although we are here for ALL teens who want to write
            with us, we focus primarily on girls and gender-expansive youth.)
        </p>

        <p>We live in such a externally-focused world, young people are often denied the time and space they need to
            express their needs and discover their voice. Consequently, the majority of teenage girls suffer from low
            self-esteem, anxiety, depression, body dysmorphic disorder, and a chronic sense of inadequacy and
            worthlessness. With this comes drug and alcohol addictions, eating disorders, unsafe sex, and codependency
            in abusive relationships. And yet, as we all know, self-esteem is an inside job. That’s why the
            internal-focus of The Intuitive Writing Project offers an antidote to the toxic pressures currently
            confronting teens. (You can read more about the mental health benefits of writing <a
                href="lifechanging.html">here</a>.)
        </p>

        <p>At The Intuitive Writing Project, we offer teens the time and space they need to go within, to connect to
            their heart, and discover not only who they really are, but who they want to become. The more they go
            within, learn to trust their intuition, and cultivate their own voice, the more they develop authentic
            self-esteem and self-trust, the very foundation of happiness, health and personal growth. We are here to
            support young people in becoming the authors and leaders of their own lives, the kind of visionary thinkers
            who will change the story of the world.</p>
