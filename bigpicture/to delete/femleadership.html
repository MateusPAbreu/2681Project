        <h3>THE WORLD WILL BE SAVED BY THE WESTERN WOMAN.
            <br>— The Dalai Lama

    <div class="text_body">
        <p>“Know thyself.” Three thousand years ago, these words were inscribed above the Temple of Apollo at Delphi.
            For the Greeks, self-knowledge was the source of all true wisdom. It's also the foundation of feminine
            leadership, an approach which has its roots in indigenous wisdom and therefore transcends Western ideas of
            gender. According to many indigenous teachings, leadership requires the wisdom of the heart—an essentially
            feminine energy which exists in all people. True leaders ensure that power is shared, that everyone's voice
            is heard and every life is equally valued.</p>
        <p>The paradigm of feminine leadership is rooted in collaboration, compassion, consensus building, and personal
            responsibility. Conflict is seen as an opportunity to build stronger connections, a chance to listen more
            patiently and connect from the heart. Like the symbiosis in all natural ecosystems, this kind of leadership
            creates a non-hierarchical network that supports the unique contributions and authentic voice of each
            person. Unlike the philosophies of “scarcity” and “lack,” the feminine paradigm operates from the mindset of
            abundance and sufficiency. It is “power with” instead of “power over,” “the power of love overcoming the
            love of power.” The goal is always a shared one, focused on the health, balance, and well-being of all.
        </p>
        <p>When balanced human beings come together to serve the greater good, great things happen. But without this
            balance, we fall into chaos. Violence, tyranny, poverty, sickness, and ecological destruction have been the
            result. Right now, all the qualities most needed for the healing of the planet (and ourselves) are the
            qualities of the feminine. Now more than ever, we need feminine leaders, human beings who both empathic and
            honest, grounded and visionary. At the Intuitive Writing Project, we are dedicated to supporting the next
            generation of visionary feminine leaders.
