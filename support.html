                <li>Creative writing cultivates social and emotional intelligence, creative problem solving skills, critical thinking skills, 
                    effective communication skills and, of course, exceptional writing skills.</li>

                <li>The discovery of one’s authentic voice builds confidence in one's self, both as a writer and a leader. 
                    Having a clear sense of your own strengths and how to communicate your story sets you apart in college essays, 
                    job applications and virtually everything you do in life.</li>

                <li>According to the book Your Brain On Art, a regular practice of creative writing has been shown to lower stress levels, reduce anxiety, 
                    alleviate depression, improve the capacity to stay focused and calm, enhance cognitive abilities and executive function, 
                    and improve academic and job performance.</li>

                <li>A culture of unconditional and mutual support builds a judgment-free female community—the antidote to social media culture—which fosters the inner strength 
                    to stand up for what you believe in.
                </li>

                <li>A focus on the inner life of each writer supports girls in knowing that who they really are matters, that their voices are powerful and need to be heard.</li>
