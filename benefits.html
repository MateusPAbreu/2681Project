                    <li><strong>The Intuitive Writing Project offers an antidote to social media
                            culture.</strong><br>
                        As girls learn to own
                        their story and discover their unique values, strengths, and passions, they develop a
                        foundation
                        of self-awareness and self-esteem that becomes protective armor against the adverse
                        influences
                        of social media. Our programs also provide the community and social connection that supports
                        girls' overall happiness and well-being.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>We build critical thinking skills in an AI world.</strong><br>
                        In learning to articulate and organize their
                        thoughts, girls develop the critical thinking skills to solve complex problems and make
                        smart
                        choices. In this way, girls are empowered to find their answers through their own intuitive
                        intelligence.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>We offer an empowering refuge from the pressure to be "perfect"</strong> so girls
                        can
                        grow more confident
                        in their authenticity.

                    <li>
                        <strong>We guide girls to discover and articulate their unique talents, strengths, passions,
                            and

                    </li>
                    <li><strong>We help girls develop "story-intelligence," the ability to own their story and
                            advocate
                            for
                            themselves in all aspects of life</strong>, including college, jobs, internship

                        <strong>Through writing, girls learn proven tools to manage stress and anxiety, become more
                            focused and
                            relaxed, and develop the resilience and optimism</strong> they need to take charge of
                        their
                        lives and

                        <strong>Through class discussion, girls learn to be skilled and insightful
                            conversationalists</strong>, as we
                        explore the real-world, global events that impact their lives most, asking deep questions
                        and
                        encouraging open dialogue.

                    <li>
                        From sharing ideas to offering peer feedback, <strong>girls learn to speak up with

                        Whether or not they started out liking writing, girls learn to love itâ€”and <strong>to become
                            exceptionally talented writers</strong>, a skill which will set them apart everywhere
                        from
