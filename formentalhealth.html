        <l1>In a world that mostly discounts or disrespects the insights of young people, The Intuitive Writing Project
            is here to listen to, honor, and respect their wisdom.</l1>
        <l1>In a surface-focused culture, The Intuitive Writing Project is here to offer young people the time and space
            they need to look within and have their stories heard, valued and validated.</l1>
        <l1>Whereas the larger culture prioritizes external achievement and fosters insecurity, The Intuitive Writing
            Project prioritizes authentic self-expression and fosters self-trust.</l1>
        <l1>Whereas most academic environments are based in criticism and competition, The Intuitive Writing Project
            offers a culture of unconditional and mutual support.</l1>
        <l1>Whereas teens are conditioned to focus on appearances, The Intuitive Writing Project focuses on inner
            strength and introspection.</l1>
        <l1>Whereas teens expect to be judged and ranked, The Intuitive Writing Project insists that everyone is equally
            respected, valued, and celebrated.</l1>
        <l1>Whereas teens are often expected to override or ignore their feelings, The Intuitive Writing Project offers
            a safe, structured space to process and grow from every experience.</l1>
        <l1>Whereas most young people struggle to know who they are, The Intuitive Writing Project supports each
            individual in finding their voice and discovering their unique passions, strengths, and values.</l1>
        <l1>Whereas it is easy to feel despair about the state of the world, writing with The Intuitive Writing Project
            fosters emotional resilience, self-empowerment and engaged leadership.</l1>
        <l1>Whereas many young people feel isolated and alone, assuming they donâ€™t matter, writing your story and having
            it validated by a supportive community empowers everyone to love and trust themselves, and to know their
            voice voice needed.</l1>
