    <div id="note_for_parents">
        <p>There is no more influential or challenging role than being a parent. We believe that parents are heroes.
            That’s
            why we are here support you, to provide a “creative antidote” to the relentless pressures that confront
            young
            people—the moment they walk out the door or look down at their screens. Our mission is to give young people
            the
            tools and resources they need to become their best, most authentic, most confident selves.</p>

        <p>In all our work with teens, we’ve found several universal themes. Teens today feel overwhelmed by both
            academic
            and social pressure: the pressure to succeed and the pressure to conform. What young people really want is a
            safe place to speak their truth, be themselves, and feel connected and supported. This is precisely what we
            work
            to provide.</p>

            <li>What’s the practical benefit of writing?</li>
            <div>
                <p>A: While social media allow us to communicate with simplicity and breadth, writing ensures complexity
                    and depth. The more a young person writes, the more they understands who they are. This enables them
                    to
                    cultivate a unique point of view, the single most essential element in all exceptional
                    writing—including
                    college application essays! Likewise, the more young people enjoy writing and the more often they
                    write,
                    the more their technique will improve, as well. Last but not least, a young person who knows how to
                    connect with themself will also know how to connect—and effectively communicate—with the people
                    around
                    her. (Including her parents!)</p>

            <li>How does this program support my child’s growth and development?</li>
            <div>
                <p>A: In his book Brainstorm: The Power and Purpose of the Teenage Brain, Dr. Dan Siegel talks about the
                    importance of “emotional stimulation, social engagement, novelty, and creative exploration”—all
                    experiences that are directly supported by expressive activities like writing as part of a group.
                    The
                    experience of being heard and validated in a positive writing community also helps to cultivate the
                    qualities Daniel Goldman has written most famously about, including emotional intelligence, social
                    intelligence, and the ability to focus. The more a young person writes, the more they discover who
                    they
                    are, what they value and how they want to contribute to the world.</p>

                <p>Additionally, our focus on positive feedback empowers kids to become better writers and stronger
                    thinkers. You can read more about the science behind positive feedback in the latest article by
                    <a title="The feedback fallacy" target="_blank"

            <li>How does this program support my child’s academic and career success?</li>
            <div>
                <p>A: As Daniel Pink wrote in his book, A Whole New Mind: Why Right-Brainers Will Rule The Future, most
                    of
                    our left-brain skills can now be automated and outsourced. “In an age of abundance… mastery of
                    design,
                    empathy, play and other seemingly ‘soft’ aptitudes is now the main way for individuals and firms to
                    stand out in a crowded marketplace.” At the Intuitive Writing Project, we believe that creative
                    writing
                    and self-reflection can foster precisely the kind of whole-brain thinking our world needs most.
                    Likewise, there is no more persuasive college application than the one written with heart-felt
                    conviction and an original point of view. It is passion that opens doors. And it is intuition that
                    helps
                    us know which doors to knock on.</p>

                <p>You can also read about the growing research demonstrating the value of a creative education, the way
                    activities like expressive writing teach us to think critically and discover more creative solutions
                    to
                    global problems.</p>

            <li>How does writing support the social, emotional and mental health of my child?</li>
            <div>
                <p>A: At the end of the day, we all need the same thing: a place to tell our story and people to listen,
                    understand and validate our experiences. This is exactly what our writing community provides. In
                    fact, girls often call our classes "the best part" of their week and "better than therapy." While
                    writing is NOT a replacement for therapy (we are big advocates for therapy for all of us!), writing
                    with other kids in an unconditionally supporitve enviroment can be quite therapeutic. As we write
                    about our experinces, we recontexulaize them, reclaiming our power and personal agency.
