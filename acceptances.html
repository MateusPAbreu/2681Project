        <h1>Some thoughts from our writers on how TIWP supported them in getting into college:</h1>

        <div id="students_accounts">
            <div id="a1">
                "TIWP changed my life. Through writing in TIWP as a highschooler, I learned who I am, my passions,
                dreams, insecurities, strength,
                my perceptions of myself, and of the world around me. Having a safe, inspiring place to dig deep,
                gave me the opportunity to discover parts of myself that were, until then, undiscovered. With the
                support of an incredible TIWP mentor and lovely,
                thought-provoking classmates, that self-awareness became self-acceptance, and then, self-love. These
                strengths have led me to heights I don’t believe
                I would otherwise have reached without the growth I exhibited as a TIWP student. Since graduating from
                TIWP,
                I have continued writing for the purposes of understanding myself in the world. I believe my strengths
                and values – empathy, curiosity, sisterhood,
                grace, justice – have clarified my life path. I want to be someone who makes a true change in the world
                for the better,
                someone who leads with empathy and compassion. TIWP help me realize that. I am forever grateful to TIWP
                and its magic.” —
                Julia, TIWP graduating class of 2020 + USC alumni who has recently been accepted at Yale Law School
            </div>

            <div id="a2">
                “TIWP is a transformative experience for your child through meaningful connections with other writers,
                self-expression,
                and the fundamentals of writing. I would not be who I am today without TIWP and whole heartedly
                recommend this program!” – Izzy

            <div id="a3">
                “Hot tip! I heard writing essays about Poetic Playlist gets you into your dream college!”
                — Hazel, future freshman at Cornell
            </div>

            <div id="a4">
                “Being a part of TIWP showcases commitment and passion, two of the most important attributes of a
                student who is well-equipped for college.
                At TIWP, every student experiences the highly unique opportunity to receive not only mentorship for
                their writing but for their own personal empowerment
                journey. TIWP elevated my college applications... displaying confidence in my own strengths, skills, and
                curiosities.”
            </div>

            <div id="a5">
                “My experience at TIWP demonstrated an ability to stay engaged with a program that had to do with my
                major (Communications/Business)
                for an extended period. It was a great resume builder, considering the focal points of the program, and
                also improved my writing skills!”
            </div>

            <div id="a6">
                “When applying to colleges, you need to know who you are and be able to write about yourself.
                No high school class or college counselor can help you gain those skills like TIWP does.
                TIWP also allows for you to explore your hobbies, morals, interests, disinterests and all-around self
                discovery,
                all of which are aspects that can help you pick the school that is very best for you.”
            </div>

            <div id="a7">
                “The Intuitive Writing Project helped me grow as a creative and academic writer,
                while also teaching me valuable skills about sharing and listening to others’ writing. During the
                college essay-writing process,
                my knowledge and growth from TIWP helped me immensely, from choosing a topic to write about to editing
                and sharing the writing.”
            </div>

            <div id="a8">
                “Writing with TIWP helped a lot with being able to answer college essay questions with both sincerity
                and eloquence.
                I mostly wrote fiction during my time at TIWP, but the practice made me a better writer in all areas.”
            </div>

            <div id="a9">
                “TIWP allowed me multiple leadership opportunities that helped me to demonstrate my abilities to
                prospective colleges.” — DB
            </div>

            <div id="a10">
                “The ability to reflect on your thoughts through creative writing, especially in a safe and supportive
                space like TIWP,
                is a great skill to build over time. That practice prepares you for applications and life!”
