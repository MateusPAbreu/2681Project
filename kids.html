            <p>This creative writing class for 7th-8th grade girls and gender-expansive youth is focused on building
                self-awareness, Emotional and Social Intelligence (ESI), story intelligence, and intuitive
                self-confidence—while also having a lot of fun!
            </p>
            <p>In this playful environment, students learn to find joy and self-mastery in the stories and worlds they
                create. It's also a safe space for students to address any personal challenges that make come up through
                the
                writing or group discussion. Each session involves an inspirational content, imaginative writing
                prompts,
                and time to write, share, and receive feedback.
            </p>
            <p>The Intuitive Writing Project philosophy is rooted in the belief that everyone is a storyteller with
                their own unique voice. We support the development of one’s voice by focusing on the strengths of the
                writing. The more students write and share, the more they learn to believe in themselves, both as
                writers and as people.
            </p>
            <p>
                Note: If your daughter already loves to write, we can support her emerging creative voice. If she
                doesn't (yet) enjoy writing, she will get to experience how fun, cathartic, and empowering it is.
