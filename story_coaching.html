            <p>To tell your story is to own your narrative and reclaim your power. In this 1:1 coaching session, I will
                guide you with tailored writing prompts and questions to write whatever stories or poems are burning
                inside
                of you, needing to be expressed. Then I will help you edit what you have written to reflect your most
                authentic voice. Finally, I will guide you through the self-publishing process, in which you learn more
                about editing and book design using the platforms Reedsy and Canva. We will also discuss website
                building,
                including the process of purchasing your own domain, establishing your online presence as a published
                author
                and how you will promote your thought leadership over time. In the end, each writer will emerge with a
                professional quality book (with both soft and hard cover options) printed through Blurb, which can be
                posted
                on any online platform and sold in any bookstore.

            <p>“Don’t ask what the world needs. Ask what makes you come alive—and then go and do that. Because what the
                world needs is people who have come alive!” — Harold Thurman
            </p>
            <p>
                Because it took me over twenty years to find my own path, I have spent a lot of time reading career
                books,
                working with career counselors, and journaling about the big, existential questions: who am I, why am I
                here, what are my strengths, and how can I use my strengths in service to others? In the process, I
                developed a series of self-empowering tools I love to share with anyone who's seeking more clarity or
                focus
                in their lives.

                In this work, I draw upon wisdom from The Myers Briggs Type Indicator, The Enneagram, The VIA Institute

                Bolles,
                and various creative writing prompts, including questions about what you loved to play (and why) when
                you
                were a kid and expressing your most authentic nature. Most importantly, I use my empathy and intuition
                to
                help each person recognize and "own" their unique talents and strengths and how they want to use them.

            <h1>College + Grad School Essay Coaching</h1>
            <h2>Tell your story in a powerful, authentic way.</h2>

            <p>
                Essay coaching is about empowering each student to find their own authentic voice. I am able to do this
                by
                creating a safe, encouraging space for sharing and self-reflection. Then I mirror back what I hear,
                affirming each person's unique strengths and values as the heroes and heroines of their own life story.
                In
                this way, I am able to focus on the qualities colleges and universities value most including independent
                thought, self-awareness, emotional resilience, social intelligence, and personal leadership.
            </p>
            <p>
                This kind of essay coaching is about helping the writer think creatively and strategically about the
                most
                important experiences of their life—and then how to tell their story in a brave, inspiring way.
                Ultimately,
                my focus is on supporting writers holistically, to help each student speak their truth and feel
                confident
                about who they are and where they're headed.

                I am proud to say that every student who’s written with me has been accepted into one of their
                first-choice

                Smith,

            <p>We are all born with our own voice, our own talents, and our own unique greatness. Unfortunately, by the
                time
                we're 13, most of us have been so criticized, shamed, and discouraged, we lose all faith in ourselves.
                But
                because we are storytellers, we make up stories about it. The way we internalize other people's
                judgments is
                to tell ourself the story that they must be "right" and we must be "wrong." These stories are also
                called
                self-limiting beliefs. These beliefs can feel like "facts" we cannot change—until we share them with a
                compassionate listener who can help us examine them more closely, to question their veracity, and to
                discover our own truth, for ourselves. As e.e. cummings once wrote,“We do not believe in ourselves until
                someone reveals that deep inside us something is valuable, worth listening to, worthy of our trust,
                sacred
                to our touch."

            <p>
                As I often tell my teens, I am not here to teach them or tell them what to do. I believe we are all the
                experts of our own heart and that my job is just to support each person in re-connecting to what they
                already know—their own intuitive wisdom—and then to help them build the resilience to stay connected, to
                develop the inner-authority and self-trust they'll need to grow and thrive.

            <p>We are all storytellers. Everything we think, say, and believe is a story. But some of our stories are
                less
                empowering than others. Without realizing it, a lot of the stories we tell ourselves—silently, in our
                heads—can be quite painful and limiting. (I know this all too well.) It is through writing—and then
                sharing
                our words with a compassionate witness—that we "break the spell" of old, outdated stories, connecting to
                our
                unique talents and strengths and creating the life we’ve always wanted to live.
            </p>
            <p>
                Whatever you're struggling with, whatever you want more clarity on, I am here to support you in
                reconnecting
                to your intuitive wisdom and rediscovering your own authentic voice. The magic of the process comes from
                the
                fact that the answers are always inside of us—and we find them when we share our story.
