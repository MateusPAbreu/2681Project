        <h1>Story Coaching</h1>
        <h2>Write, edit, & self-publish your own book</h2>
        <p>To tell your story is to own your narrative and reclaim your power. In this 1:1 coaching session, I will
            guide you with tailored writing prompts and questions to write whatever stories or poems are burning inside
            of you, needing to be expressed. Then I will help you edit what you have written to reflect your most
            authentic voice. Finally, I will guide you through the self-publishing process, in which you learn more
            about editing and book design using the platforms Reedsy and Canva. We will also discuss website building,
            including the process of purchasing your own domain, establishing your online presence as a published author
            and how you will promote your thought leadership over time. In the end, each writer will emerge with a
            professional quality book (with both soft and hard cover options) printed through Blurb, which can be posted
            on any online platform and sold in any bookstore.

        <h1>Career Coaching</h1>
        <h2>Discover your strengths. Find your path.</h2>
        <p>“Don’t ask what the world needs. Ask what makes you come alive—and then go and do that. Because what the
            world needs is people who have come alive!” — Harold Thurman
        </p>
        <p>
            Because it took me over twenty years to find my own path, I have spent a lot of time reading career books,
            working with career counselors, and journaling about the big, existential questions: who am I, why am I
            here, what are my strengths, and how can I use my strengths in service to others? In the process, I
            developed a series of self-empowering tools I love to share with anyone who's seeking more clarity or focus
            in their lives.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this work, I draw upon wisdom from The Myers Briggs Type Indicator, The Enneagram, The VIA Institute on
            Character Strengths Test, Brene Brown’s “Dare To Lead” List of Values, The Clifton StrengthsFinder 2.0, The
            Seven Personality Archetypes by Dr. Elizabeth Puttick, What Color Is Your Parachute? by Richard N. Bolles,
            and various creative writing prompts, including questions about what you loved to play (and why) when you
            were a kid and expressing your most authentic nature. Most importantly, I use my empathy and intuition to
            help each person recognize and "own" their unique talents and strengths and how they want to use them.

        <h1>College + Grad School Essay Coaching</h1>
        <h2>Tell your story in a powerful, authentic way.</h2>
        <p>
            Essay coaching is about empowering each student to find their own authentic voice. I am able to do this by
            creating a safe, encouraging space for sharing and self-reflection. Then I mirror back what I hear,
            affirming each person's unique strengths and values as the heroes and heroines of their own life story. In
            this way, I am able to focus on the qualities colleges and universities value most including independent
            thought, self-awareness, emotional resilience, social intelligence, and personal leadership.
        </p>
        <p>
            This kind of essay coaching is about helping the writer think creatively and strategically about the most
            important experiences of their life—and then how to tell their story in a brave, inspiring way. Ultimately,
            my focus is on supporting writers holistically, to help each student speak their truth and feel confident
            about who they are and where they're headed.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am proud to say that every student who’s written with me has been accepted into one of their first-choice
            undergrad and grad schools, including Columbia, Yale, Brown, Northeastern, Northwestern, Tufts, the
            University of Michigan, USC, UCLA, UCSB, UCSC, UCSD, UC Berkeley, Cal Poly, NYU, Rutgers, Haverford, Smith,
            Bryn Mawr, American University, Duke, and Harvard Law School.Truly, a well-told story can change your life.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>During the first session, we talk through, outline, and complete a first draft of the personal essay,
                which usually takes two hours.</li>
            <li>Subsequent sessions (especially with supplemental essays) can usually be completed in one hour.</li>
            <li>Rate is $150 per hour.</li>
            <li>Edits and revisions are offered via Google docs for free.</li>

        <h1>Empowerment Coaching</h1>
        <h2>Tell your story. Claim your authority.</h2>
        <p>We are all born with our own voice, our own talents, and our own unique greatness. Unfortunately, by the time
            we're 13, most of us have been so criticized, shamed, and discouraged, we lose all faith in ourselves. But
            because we are storytellers, we make up stories about it. The way we internalize other people's judgments is
            to tell ourself the story that they must be "right" and we must be "wrong." These stories are also called
            self-limiting beliefs. These beliefs can feel like "facts" we cannot change—until we share them with a
            compassionate listener who can help us examine them more closely, to question their veracity, and to
            discover our own truth, for ourselves. As e.e. cummings once wrote,“We do not believe in ourselves until
            someone reveals that deep inside us something is valuable, worth listening to, worthy of our trust, sacred
            to our touch."
        </p>
        <p>
            As I often tell my teens, I am not here to teach them or tell them what to do. I believe we are all the
            experts of our own heart and that my job is just to support each person in re-connecting to what they
            already know—their own intuitive wisdom—and then to help them build the resilience to stay connected, to
            develop the inner-authority and self-trust they'll need to grow and thrive.

        <h1>MY PHILOSOPHY</h1>
        <p>We are all storytellers. Everything we think, say, and believe is a story. But some of our stories are less
            empowering than others. Without realizing it, a lot of the stories we tell ourselves—silently, in our
            heads—can be quite painful and limiting. (I know this all too well.) It is through writing—and then sharing
            our words with a compassionate witness—that we "break the spell" of old, outdated stories, connecting to our
            unique talents and strengths and creating the life we’ve always wanted to live.
        </p>
        <p>
            Whatever you're struggling with, whatever you want more clarity on, I am here to support you in reconnecting
            to your intuitive wisdom and rediscovering your own authentic voice. The magic of the process comes from the
            fact that the answers are always inside of us—and we find them when we share our story.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="empowerment_help">
        <p>While therapy is invaluable for the healing and recovery process, empowerment coaching is about
            self-discovery and self-invention, reconnecting to who you really are and making choices that align with
            your greater purpose. (And yes, we all have a greater purpose, which is something I can help you uncover, as
            well.)</p>
        <p>Empowerment coaching begins with the assumption that you are already a powerful, amazing, incredibly creative
            human being, born with your own unique combination of talents, strengths, and gifts, gifts the world
            needs—and only you can express.</p>
        <p>My job, as your coach, is just to help you reconnect to the magic that already exists inside of you—that has
            always existed inside of you—to cultivate self-awareness, self-trust, and self-confidence. (The reason I
            have made this my job is because my unique gift is the ability to see the unique gifts in others.) It all
            starts with self-reclamation, reclaiming your power as the author, protagonist, and director your own life
            story.</p>
        <p>When we don’t know who we are or what we want, we are easily sidetracked—pulled down incompatible paths with
            incompatible people—like secondary characters in someone else’s movie. But when we connect to who we
            are—when we find our authentic voice and discover our unique talents, strengths, values, and interests—we
            reclaim our power as the authors and hero/ines of our own lives. Then we can consciously choose the friends,
            the activities, the classes, the colleges, the majors, the internships, the partners, and the careers that
            will celebrate and support our uniqueness, imbuing us with a sense of being valued, needed and connected to
            something greater. Most importantly, when have a clear sense of who we are, we are connected to our own
            intuitive wisdom—our own internal GPS—which gives us the confidence and clarity we need to create an
            authentic, connected, meaningful, and very fulfilling life.
