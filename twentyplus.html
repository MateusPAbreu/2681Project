            Write to Find Your Own Answers & Create the Life You Want
        </h2>
        <p>In this once-a-month writing program, the focus is on both creative and professional empowerment, supporting
            each writer in reflecting upon their interests, values, and strengths along with their their own definition
            "success" in the design of a truly authentic, fulfilling life. Through the magic of the creative process,
            writers discover their own wisdom, solve their own problems and find their own answers.</p>
        <p>The Intuitive Writing Project philosophy is rooted in the belief that everyone is a storyteller with their
            own unique voice. We support the development of oneâ€™s voice by focusing on the strengths of the writing.</p>
