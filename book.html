            <div id="intro_text">
                <p>Intuition is our most advanced and empowering intelligence. It is our light in the dark, our clarity
                    in
                    the chaos, our most unerring inner compass. And yet, because we live in an intuition-negating world,
                    it
                    can be really hard to hear it. We are all born creative, intuitive, and immeasurably powerful—and
                    yet,
                    the world conditions us to believe otherwise. The question, then, is how do we learn to trust
                    ourselves,
                    in a world that would rather we didn't?
                </p>
                <p>
                    After a lifetime of journaling and twelve years of leading intuitive writing programs for teenage
                    girls
                    and women, I have come to believe that the single most efficient, effective, and reliable way to
                    reclaim
                    our intuitive wisdom and learn to trust ourselves... is through writing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The reason writing is revolutionary is because it empowers us to act upon the wisdom of our heart,
                    which
                    is love. And the reason writing works wonders is because YOU are a wonder—and writing reveals the
                    magic
                    that has always been inside of you.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div id="book_explain">
            <p>After playing with many (many!) different words for the title, the reason I chose the verb “reclaim," as
                in
                reclaiming our intuitive wisdom, is because learning to trust ourselves IS a reclamation process. I know
                this
                because I spent most of my life not trusting myself. I had to work really heart to reclaim my
                self-trust.
                I’m
                still working on it. But now, wherever I get stuck or confused (which is often), I write about it. It is
                through
                writing that I have learned to find my own answers. The same can be true for you!</p>

            <p>As you will learn when you read the book, the image of the mostly-submerged pencil is a metaphor for a
                mostly-submerged iceberg, which is a metaphor for the fact that our intuition is mostly hidden from
                us—until
                we
                start to write. While the process of writing offers no quick fixes—no microwave “popcorn” button we can
                press to
                make the magic happen faster—it does work overtime, like rain and sun on seeds, slowing growing new
                insights
                and
                awareness, from the inside out.</p>

            <p>What I know for sure is that if you let yourself write, and keep writing, you will discover things about
                yourself—beautiful, empowering, magical things—you didn’t know you contained. If you’re struggling,
                writing
                offers courage. If you’re feeling alone, writing offers comfort. And if you’re looking for answers, I
                believe
                you will find them in yourself, in the power of your own words, scribbled wildly across the page.</p>

            <p>As I often tell my students, writing turns our pen into a sort of magical wand, revealing the magic that
                has
                been inside us all along. It is, in short, word magic.</p>

        <div id="what_in">
            <p>This book contains the creative, spiritual, and philosophical DNA of The Intuitive Writing Project. This
                book
                is
                intended to be the magic-in-a-bottle version of its magical source, both for those who know me well and
                those
                who don’t know me at all. This book offers both creative and practical tools (and lots of writing
                prompts)
                to
                reclaim, remember, and reassert our own intuitive wisdom.</p>

            <p>I've designed it to be big (8x10") and colorful (you can see some sample spreads to the right) and it's
                broken
                into 3 main sections:</p>

            <ol>
                <strong>
                    <li>Trust your voice.</li>
                    <li>Reclaim your intuition.</li>
                    <li>Tell your story.</li>
                </strong>
            </ol>

            <p>There's also an appendix at the end, for "Everything You Didn't Know You Wanted to Know About The
                Intuitive
                Writing Project," including a very lengthy Acknowledgements section, thanking the many, many people (if
                you
                are
                reading this, you are probably one of them) who helped to make the whole concept possible. Throughout
                the
                book,
                I also remind you keep your focus on your own thoughts, feelings, and perceptions, and to use only the
                prompts
                that resonate for you.</p>

            <p>I don’t know what lies ahead for any of us, but I know that the more you write, the more you will
                understand
                and
                trust yourself. And the more we all learn to trust ourselves, the more we will be able to trust each
                other,
                to
                come together to build a world in which everyone is cared for and everyone can thrive.</p>
