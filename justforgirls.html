            gender non-conforming youth, gender queer youth and any girl-identified youth. Everyone who wants to write
            with us is warmly welcome!

            <p>Dear You,</p>
            <p>
                In the same way that the world has been biased toward cis men (over women and non-binary people), it's
                also biased toward adults (over young people). I am here to help counter both biases. It has been my
                experience that girls and gender-expansive youth are the most intelligent, insightful, intuitive,
                creative, courageous, spiritually conscious, and visionary people on the planet—and I have dedicated my
                life to making sure your voices are heard and supported. But first, we have to learn to listen to and
                love ourselves. As you will see below, this page offers book recs and writing prompts for you to connect
                to your own wisdom. I hope they help you to see what I see, that you are a Magic-maker—and the author
                and hero/ine of your own life story.
            </p>
            <p>With love and sisterhood,
                <br>
                Elizabeth
