        <h1>The Intuitive Writing Perspective on AI vs. Youth-Generated* Writing</h1>
        <div class="quote">
            "Writing is a quintessentially human endeavor, shaped by experience, deep knowledge, an awareness of the
            audience, and a genuine desire to communicate... It’s more than just assembling facts and stringing them
            together in a grammatically acceptable manner."

        <p>At The Intuitive Writing Project, we write for catharsis, for empowerment and for fun. We are here to offer
            girls the time and space they need to go inward, to draw strength and inspiration from within. While we
            certainly respect the functionality of AI as a practical tool, we also know that it can never replace the
            physical, mental, emotional and spiritual experience of writing and speaking your truth.
        </p>
        <p>The more girls enjoy writing, the more they write, and the more they write, the more their writing surpasses
            anything AI can generate. But the most important aspect of our writing program is not the quality of the
            writing (although the quality is always very high) but the experience of articulating your own truths,
            finding your own voice and learning to believe in yourself.
        </p>

        <p>Living in such an externally-focused world, this is a big part of what makes our programs unique, the way in
            which we support the <a href="https://www.elizabethperlman.com/post/confidence-building-for-girls"
                target="_blank">intrinsic confidence of girls</a>. In fact, we believe that inner-strength-building is
            the
            single most important <a
                href="https://www.elizabethperlman.com/post/the-power-of-girls-writing-together">antidote to the current
                mental health crisis affecting girls</a>. Whereas most girls (and
            women and all people, really) have been conditioned to look for answers "out there," all spiritual teachings
            guide us back to the greater truth, that the wisdom and peace we seek is always inside of us. It is through
            writing that we connect to "that still, quiet voice within"—and through writing that we find our own
            answers.
