        <p>The Intuitive Writing Project is just one small part of what has become a global revolution in human
            consciousness, the collective effort of countless individuals and groups in breaking from old tyrannies—both
            political and psychological—in order create more balanced, authentic, self-directed lives. In the words of
            Gloria Steinem (in her book of the same name) this is a Revolution from Within: personal transformation on a
            planetary scale.</p>
        <p>At the highest level, intuition conveys spiritual truths, helping us to understand who we are, what we need,
            and why we’re here. In day-to-day life, intuition helps us live with integrity and confidence, enabling us
            to make more conscious, clear-minded decisions. Our intuition makes us ingenious. The only challenge is
            learning to trust it. This can be hard only because we’ve been so thoroughly discouraged from trusting
            ourselves.</p>
        <p>At the Intuitive Writing Project, we believe that each person is the expert and authority of their own
            individual experience. We also believe that—in the places we have been divided from ourselves, shut down or
            split apart—there are ways of reconnecting, ways of remembering who we really are. We believe that writing
            is one of the ways.</p>
        <p>In this time of tectonic change, intuitive self-trust is the revolution, a revolution in creativity and
            personal power. At the Intuitive Writing Project, we want to help launch self-trust as a movement, to
            galvanize all people—of every age and gender—to look within their own hearts and trust their own intuition.
