        <p>Every once in a while, you may be fortunate enough to have your child share their writing with you. (It may
            not happen often, but when it does, it's a beautiful thing!) In the event that your child reads their story
            to you or lets you read some of their published writing, here are some tips for fostering a deeper
            connection. Because we use the Amherst Writing Method in all of our classes, we recommend that you
            incorporate this philosophy into your feedback, as well.
        </p>

        <div class="list">
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>The Amherst Writing Method was developed by the visionary writer and teacher Pat Schneider. The
                        underlying philosophy is that everyone is a writer with their own unique voice. We find our
                        voice by
                        writing our story and having it heard.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        The way the Amherst Writing Method creates safe space is to treat all writing (no matter how
                        personal) as a work of creative fiction. This helps us focus on the beauty and strength of the
                        language without invading the writer’s privacy or trying to “fix,” “help” or give advice.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is through writing that we clarify and resolve our own problems. The very act of writing is
                        an
                        act of self-instruction and self-discovery. Through the writing process, we can trust that each
                        writer will be guided to their own wisdom.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Most importantly, the Amherst Writing Method insists that all feedback be positive, focused on
                        the
                        power, strength, and authenticity of the writing. We listen for the words, ideas, thoughts and
                        feelings that resonate for us and share our appreciation, as in “I loved how the writer
                        described
                        the _________," or "I loved the line about the _________."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We like to listen to the writing the same way we listen to music, letting the beauty and power
                        of
                        words wash over us and then sharing what we loved. The greatest gift we can give another person
                        is
                        to be fully present to them and to listen with an open heart.
                    </p>

        <p>In short, every writer needs be heard, validated and supported. The more we can acknowledge a young person’s
            strengths, the more they will be able to trust in their ability as writers. The more that they trust
            themselves, the more they will enjoy writing and the stronger their writing will become.
        </p>

        <p>Until young people are more confident in their writing skills, we do not recommend entering any writing
            contests, as the critical treatment of writing in a contest—so much like school—can reactivate the very
            "inner critic" we're trying to free them from.
        </p>

        <p>Finally, if your child doesn't want to share their writing with you, it's okay. Don’t take it personally. A
            lot of what the kids write about is very deep and personal, more like a journal entry than an essay. At the
            same time, you can be reassured that this kind of expressive writing fosters exceptional emotional
            intelligence, which is the foundation of all professional and personal success. It is through the process of
            writing that we are able to make sense of our lives, to figure out who we are and to make conscious choices
            about who we want to become.
        </p>

        <p>Our hope is that by the time your child graduates from high school, they will know and trust themselves
            enough to become truly visionary leaders and change-makers—which is exactly what the world needs most!
            Together we can change the world: one person, one voice, and one story at a time.</p>
