        Since 2013, we have facilitated over 4,000 hours of classes and workshops for over 500 young people, 
        publishing over 1,000 pieces of student writing and five printed anthologies. 
        Most of our students continue to write with us every week and every year until they leave for college. 
        (100% of high school graduates go on to exceptional colleges.) Over time, 
        our writers learn to see themselves as the authors and leaders of their own livesâ€”and that changes everything.
