        <h2>HELP US CLOSE THE WRITING GAP</h2>
        <div>
            More than grades, SAT scores or sports, writing opens dooers -just as an inability to write keeps those doors shut.
            When girls write with the Intuive Writing Project, they discover who they are, what they value and how to tell their story.
            Every single one of our graduates has gotten into their first-choice, top-tier college.
            Imagine what would be possible if every girl had the same opportunity to develop their voice as writers.

            The more underserved girls are empowered to write write their story, the more they are empowered to be successful in every aspect of their lives.
