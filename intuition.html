            <p>In these unprecedented times, how do we find the clarity we need to make the most empowered choices? The
                answer is simple but not easy—<strong><em>because the truth we seek is always inside of us.</em></strong></p>

            <p>The challenge is learning to trust it, <strong><em>to trust ourselves</em></strong>, in a world that would rather we didn't. </p>

            <p>Three thousand years ago, the words <strong>“Know thyself,"</strong> were inscribed above the Temple of Apollo at Delphi.
                For
                the Greeks, self-knowledge was the source of all true wisdom. It's also the foundation of intuitive
                leadership, the idea that leadership begins within, in connecting to our own intuitive wisdom.</p>

            <p>First, we must take the time to look inward, to discover who we really are and what really matters to us,
                to
                know and trust ourselves. In my experience, the single most effective way to connect to our heart and
                access
                our wisdom is to give ourselves the time and space we need to write. It's not academic writing or
                business
                writing. It's stream-of-conscious, expressive, intuitive writing. And as we write, the pen becomes a
                funnel,
                synthesizing the enormity of our experiences into rational, linear language, <strong><em>showing us what we didn’t
                know
                we knew</em></strong>—and galvanizing us to act upon it. When we write and share in a group, the group validates and
                reinforces the strength of each individual. This is what girls need to know and trust themselves, first
                as
                individuals and then as leaders.
            </p>

            <p>After twelve years of leading writing-based, intuitive leadership programs for teenage girls, I can tell
                you
                unequivocally that the weekly practice of intuitive writing empowers girls to believe in themselves, to
                understand their values, strengths, and passions, and then to advocate for themselves and others, in
                joyful
                alignment with their own values and leadership style. </p>

            <p>The paradigm of intuitive leadership is rooted in collaboration, compassion, consensus-building, and
                personal
                responsibility—qualities that just so happen to be innate to what Dr. Louann Brizendine calls "the
                female
                brain." But the goal of intuitive leadership is never to put any one person or group ahead of the other.
                Like the symbiosis in all natural ecosystems, this kind of leadership creates a non-hierarchical network
                that supports the unique contributions and authentic voice of each person. It is “power with” instead of
                “power over,” what Jimi Hendrix referred to as “the power of love overcoming the love of power.” The
                goal is
                always a shared one, focused on the health, balance, and well-being of all. <strong><em>True leaders ensure that
                power</em></strong>
                is shared, that everyone's voice is heard and every life is equally valued.
            </p>

            <p>
                When balanced human beings come together to serve the greater good, great things happen. But without
                this
                balance, we fall into chaos. Violence, tyranny, poverty, sickness, and ecological destruction have been
                the
                result. Right now, all the qualities most needed for the healing of the planet (and ourselves) can be
                found
                in intuitive wisdom of women and girls.
            </p>
