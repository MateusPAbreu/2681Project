            <p>This curriculum-based program is designed to lead teens through a creative process of deepening
                self-awareness, self-empowerment, and confidence-building, <strong>to become the leader of their own life</strong>. Upon
                completion, students receive a <strong>Certificate for Intuitive Leadership</strong> which can be added to their resume.
            </p>
            <p>In addition to group discussion, writing, and speaking, we deep-dive into:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>your intuitive superpowers</strong>: cultivating intuitive self-trust</li>

                <li><strong>your story-IQ</strong>: owning your power as the author of your own life</li>

                <li><strong>social-media self-awareness</strong>: staying true to your own vision + values</li>

                <li><strong>effective communication + conflict resolution</strong>: NVC/"The Language of Compassion"</li>

                <li><strong>cultivating radical self-acceptance + a healthy body image</strong>: learning to love yourself</li>

                <li><strong>healthy boundaries in healthy relationships</strong>: learning to advocate for yourself</li>

                <li><strong>the feminine paradigm of leadership</strong>: connecting to your intuitive wisdom</li>

                <li><strong>your personal leadership style</strong>: discovering your unique talents + strengths</li>

                The Intuitive Writing Project philosophy is rooted in the belief that everyone is a storyteller with
                their own unique voice. We support the development of one’s voice by focusing on the strengths of the
                writing. The more students write and share, the more they learn to believe in themselves, both as
                writers and as people.
            </p>
            <p>
                Note: If your daughter already loves to write, we can support her emerging creative voice. If she
                doesn't (yet) enjoy writing, she will get to experience how fun, cathartic, and empowering it is.
            </p>
            <p>To ensure that each student gets personalized mentoring and support, we limit class size to 6.</p>

                In an increasingly complex world, this program offers girls a safe space for both introspection and
                connection, reflecting upon current events while discovering their unique passions, strengths, and
                personal values. <strong>As girls engage in a weekly practice of writing, they come to understand who they are
                and how to express their authentic voice as leaders—in high school, college apps, and beyond.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                Each week, we discuss a collection of carefully curated news stories, poems, short-story excerpts, and
                writing tips to encourage <strong>independent thought, critical thinking, and creative problem-solving.</strong> We also
                discuss the structure of "the heroine's journey" in all stories, <strong>finding meaning, growth, and
                resilience through the inevitable challenges of life.</strong>

            <p>In this class, proflific writers will select, edit, and lay out their strongest pieces in order to
                self-publish their own anthology of writing. Whereas most of our classes are focused on generating that
                all-important first draft (and our TIWP anthologies only feature 2-3 pieces per author), this class is
                focused on a vigorous process of editing, polishing, and culling the best writing of each writer, with a
                minimum of 15 pieces.</p>
            <p>Writers will also learn more about editing and book design using the platforms Reedsy and Canva. Those
                who
                enjoy art or photography will learn to integrate visuals into their writing and everyone will be
                empowered
                to design their own cover. We will also discuss website building, including the process of purchasing
                your
                own domain and establishing your online platform as a published author. In the end, each writer will
                emerge
                with an exceptional portfolio of writing in the form of a professional quality book (with both soft and
                hard
                cover options) printed through Blurb.</p>
