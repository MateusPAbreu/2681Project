                <h1>Elizabeth Perlman, MA</h1>
                <p>Hello fellow storytellers! My name is Elizabeth and I created The Intuitive Writing Project because
                    it's
                    what
                    I wanted and needed when I was a teen: a supportive space to write, speak, and be heard. Even after
                    twelve
                    years of leading workshops and developing curricula, I continue to be inspired (and often moved to
                    tears) by
                    the wisdom, depth, and raw, world-changing courage of my students.
                </p>
                <p>I have a BA in Media Arts and a MA in Transformative Arts, the study of creative expression as a tool
                    for
                    self-discovery, self-healing, and self-empowerment. You can read more about my eclectic "education
                    and
                    career journey," below.
                </p>
                <p>As I have written in my upcoming book (contact me to get on the mailing list for my launch date!),
                    Word
                    Magic, The Power of Writing to Reclaim Our Intuitive Wisdom, "I believe that human beings are both
                    deeply
                    wise and profoundly heroic, but that we usually can’t see it. Usually, we need some kind of
                    evidence. I
                    believe our stories are the evidence. I believe our stories contain our magic. And I believe that
                    storytelling is how we heal, uplift, and redesign our lives."

            <p><strong>An abridged-but-still-lengthy account of Elizabeth's "Education & Career Adventures"</strong>
            </p>

            <p>I began my college journey studying leadership as a Leadership Scholar at Columbia College, back when
                it was
                still a women's college. (Looking back, I think it was my experience in those all-female classes
                that
                sparked my
                passion for girl-focused education!) A few years later, I transferred to The University of South
                Carolina to
                pursue an interdisciplinary degree, combining filmmaking and environmental studies in the hope of
                producing
                "inspiring environmental documentaries." Toward that end, I spent time in Costa Rica studying
                "Sustainable
                Strategies for Rainforest Preservation" through The School for Field Studies. I also learned winter
                survival
                skills in the Rocky Mountains through Outward Bound, and spent half a year doing community service
                through
                City
                Year. I also took a year "off" (and read a lot of books on Eastern and indigenous philosophy) during
                a
                family
                health crisis. Eventually, in May of 2000, I earned my BA in Media Arts.</p>

            <p>Just four months later, after a short, ill-advised stint in corporate sales, I went back to school to
                study
                Art
                Direction & Design for Advertising at The Portfolio Center / Miami Ad School Atlanta. This led to
                over ten
                years
                in design industry, working as a graphic designer and art director to tell "visual stories of the
                brand" for
                companies like BBDO SF, Nike, and West Elm. During that time, I also spent two years popping back
                and forth
                to
                the One Spirit Learning Alliance in New York City for a low-residency, "spiritual education for
                change-makers"
                program where I was ordained an interfaith minister.</p>

            <p>Finally, with the recession of 2008, I got the chance to start over, to go back to school and study
                the thing
                I'd always been most passionate about—the power of writing to heal, transform, and empower.</p>

            <p>At John F. Kennedy University, I completed my Master's in Transformative Arts, the study of creative
                expression
                as a tool for personal inquiry and growth. It was during this time that I was certified as a Group
                Leader in
                The
                Amherst Writing Method, the beautiful writing methodology that would inspire the writing philosophy
                of The
                Intuitive Writing Project.</p>

            <p>After so many years of soul-searching, trying to find "my place" in the world, I inadvertently
                developed an
                exceptional set of life-skills and self-inquiry tools I am now able to share with others, to help my
                students
                their own "place" in the world—through both group classes and 1:1 career coaching. It took me a
                long, long
                time
                to figure out how to integrate my particular combination of passions and strengths. But I do believe
                everything
                happens for a reason. And sometimes, the reason we "can't find" the thing we need is because we are
                the ones
                who
                have to create it.</p>

            <p>As I often tell my students, if I can create and successfully run a program as unconventional as The
                Intuitive
                Writing Project, they can do ANYTHING! At the end of the day, I believe my job is just to reflect
                back the
                unique brilliance and power of each and every girl—till they can see it, too. I am here to support
                girls in
                trusting their voice, writing their story, and creating their own meaningful, empowered life.</p>

                    thoughts and ideas, writing has shaped the way I think and live. Writing is powerful, writing is

                TIWP Writer: 10th - 12th grade<br>
                <p>Writing matters because words are the fabric of our world; they make us feel understood and have the
                    power to ignite our passions. For me, The Intuitive Writing Project is a safe space for young
                    individuals to write and create without reserve, a place to discover one’s authentic voice and speak
                    it confidently.

                <p>
                    Writing matters because it is both the medium by which important voices can be heard by the world,
                    as well as a restorative practice. For me, The Intuitive Writing Project is the place where young
                    women can create, lead, and inspire—while growing into their most confident, unapologetic and truest
                    self.

                <p>Writing matters because it immortalizes extraordinary thoughts. For me, The Intuitive Writing Project

                    themselves throughout their developing years. For me, The Intuitive Writing Project opens space for
                    healing, learning, vulnerability, self-love, creativity, and magic.</p>

                    initiative where young people are celebrated for who they are, supported in and out of class, and
                    ultimately learn to find their voice.</p>
