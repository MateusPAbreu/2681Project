        <h1>Elizabeth Perlman, MA</h1>
        <p>Hello fellow storytellers! My name is Elizabeth and I created The Intuitive Writing Project because it's what
            I wanted and needed when I was a teen: a supportive space to write, speak, and be heard. Even after twelve
            years of leading workshops and developing curricula, I continue to be inspired (and often moved to tears) by
            the wisdom, depth, and raw, world-changing courage of my students.
        </p>
        <p>I have a BA in Media Arts and a MA in Transformative Arts, the study of creative expression as a tool for
            self-discovery, self-healing, and self-empowerment. You can read more about my eclectic "education and
            career journey," below.
        </p>
        <p>As I have written in my upcoming book (contact me to get on the mailing list for my launch date!), Word
            Magic, The Power of Writing to Reclaim Our Intuitive Wisdom, "I believe that human beings are both deeply
            wise and profoundly heroic, but that we usually can’t see it. Usually, we need some kind of evidence. I
            believe our stories are the evidence. I believe our stories contain our magic. And I believe that
            storytelling is how we heal, uplift, and redesign our lives."

        <h2>I love writing. Writing is how I think, how I learn, how I breathe. Again and again, writing has saved my
            life. It's still saving me.</h2>
        <strong>
            <p>I completed my first story, "Bloody Merder," (why is spelling so hard?!) when I was eight. At ten, I
                started keeping a nightly journal. By the time I was in high school, I was writing every night for
                hours. In the space between those thin blue lines, I found my own voice. But my story isn’t that
                different from anyone else’s. Every girl is on the same quest, the same “heroine’s journey” to learn and
                grow and live her truth.
            </p>
        </strong>

        <p>
            I began my college career as a Women's Leadership Scholar at Columbia College in SC. (I have always been
            fascinated with the feminine paradigm of leadership and continue to study it extensively.) But because I'm
            also passionate about storytelling and film, I ultimately earned my BA in Media Arts (with a focus on
            screenwriting) from The University of South Carolina.
        </p>

        <p>
            After a short, ill-advised stint in corporate sales, I went back to school to study Art Direction & Design
            for Advertising at The Portfolio Center, which is now Miami Ad School Atlanta. For over ten years, I worked
            as a designer and art director, telling the "visual stories of the brand" for companies like BBDO SF, Nike,
            and West Elm. During that time, I also spent two years popping back and forth to the One Spirit Learning
            Alliance in NYC for a low-residency, spiritual development program where I was ordained an interfaith
            minister. Finally, with the recession of 2008, I got the chance to start over, to go back to school and
            study the thing I'd always been most passionate about—the power of writing to heal, transform, and empower.
        </p>

        <p>
            At John F. Kennedy University, I completed my Master's in Transformative Arts, the study of creative
            expression as a tool for personal inquiry and growth. It was during this time that I was certified as a
            Group Leader in The Amherst Writing Method, the beautiful writing philosophy that would become the
            foundation of The Intuitive Writing Project (TIWP).
        </p>

        <p>
            Although I first hatched the idea for TIWP when I was just 19, it took me another twenty years to actually
            step forward and (true to my own tagline) “declare what I know to be true.” Today, our programs are the
            synthesis of everything I've learned as a woman—but wished I had learned in high school. After my very
            circuitous journey, the opportunity to listen to, encourage, and support young women continues to be the
            greatest honor and happiness of my life. To personalize the words of the great author and advocate Ayesha
            Siddiqi, everyday I strive "to be the person I needed when I when I was young."
