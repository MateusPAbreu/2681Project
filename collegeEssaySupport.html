            Like all our writing programs, coaching for the college essay supports young people in finding their own
            authentic voice.
            We do this by creating a safe space for young people to share their experiences. Then we reflect back what
            we hear, affirming their individuality,
            their strengths, and their values as authors of their own life story. In this way, we are able to focus on
            the qualities colleges value most,
            including independent thought, self-awareness, resilience, emotional intelligence and leadership.
        </p>

            This kind of essay coaching is about helping your child think creatively and strategically about the most
            important experiences of their life—and then how to
            tell their story in a brave, authentic way. Ultimately, our focus is on supporting kids holistically, to
            help each young person speak their truth and
            feel confident about who they are and where they're headed.

            We are proud to say that every student who’s written with us has been accepted into one of their
            first-choice schools.
